Hello, my name is Milan Martiniak. I'm husband, father, son and dotnet developer.
I come from Skalite. It's small village in the north of Slovakia. Now I live and work in Žilina.

In 2010 I graduated from the Faculty of Management Science and Informatics of the University of Žilina in Applied Informatics.

Since 2007 I'm .NET developer at KROS a.s. In the past I have been developing desktop aplication (WinForms and WPF). Last few years I've been focusing on cloud development. (ASP.NET Core, AZURE, ...) Nowadays I'm working as a software & cloud architect.

I'm co-autor of an open source project [KORM](https://github.com/Kros-sk/Kros.KORM). And autor/founder of an open source project [MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot](https://github.com/Burgyn/MMLib.SwaggerForOcelot). I actively take care of both of these projects.

My friend [Andrej Kollárik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-kollarik/) and I are co-authors and co-founders of [SWALLOW POLL](https://swallowpoll.com), a free online application for creating polls.

With friends from work we are starting to organize public meetups in Žilina called [KROS Dev Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/KROS-Dev-Meetup/) dedicated to software development.
Sometimes I talk about software development at the University of Žilina.

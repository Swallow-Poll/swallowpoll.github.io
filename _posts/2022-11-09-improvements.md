These are all useful improvements that could enhance the user experience of an online poll or survey tool. Here's a bit more detail on each of these suggestions:

1. More specific names of browser tabs: Having more descriptive names for the browser tabs that display a poll or survey can make it easier for users to identify and navigate between different polls. For example, instead of just displaying "Poll" as the tab name, the tool could include the title of the poll or a brief description of its purpose.

2. Better previews of poll links in messaging platforms: When sharing a poll link in a messaging platform such as MS Teams or Messenger, it can be helpful to have a preview of the poll that shows some of the questions and choices. This can give users a better sense of what the poll is about and encourage them to click through and participate.

3. Change of percentage calculation in the results of multiple vote polls: In a poll that allows users to select multiple choices, the percentage calculation for each option can be based on the total number of responses or the total number of votes. Depending on the context, either approach may be more appropriate. For example, if the poll is asking users to select all the brands they are interested in, the percentage calculation could be based on the total number of responses. If the poll is asking users to rank their top three choices, the percentage calculation could be based on the total number of votes. Allowing users to choose which approach to use could give them more control over how the results are displayed.

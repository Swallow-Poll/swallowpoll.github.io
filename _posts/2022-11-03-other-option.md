The "Other" option is a useful feature that can be added to online polls and surveys to allow respondents to provide a custom answer that may not be covered by the predefined choices.

Here are some benefits of adding an "Other" option to your polls and surveys:

1. It allows for more flexibility and creativity in answering: Respondents can provide their own unique responses that may not fit into any of the existing options.
2. It allows for more accurate data collection: By providing an "Other" option, you can ensure that you capture all relevant responses, even if they don't fit into the predefined choices.
3. It can help identify trends and patterns: By analyzing the responses to the "Other" option, you can get a better understanding of what your respondents are thinking and what issues are most important to them.

To add an "Other" option to your poll or survey, simply click the **Add "other"** link in the **Answer options** section of the poll.
